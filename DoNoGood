Lost, confused, out of place, and completely unimpressed with the offerings of this life. 
I wander through each day as if in a fog, grappling with the overwhelming sense that nothing I do truly matters. 
They tell you to do good things, promising that good things will come in return.
It is the biggest lie of our existence. 
Everything is random, with no purpose or grand plan, and absolutely no bias toward good or evil. 
Every day I strive to be a better person, yet it only seems to put me farther behind. I'm done. 
This world has proven to me that you must take what you want, regardless of intent and no matter the situation. 

If you knew the life I’ve lived and the hand that’s been dealt to me, you would understand. 
I’ve faced adversity at every turn, my dreams crushed under the weight of reality. 
My skill set can make me a millionaire, but I’m not waiting for the universe to come around. 
It’s too little, too late. I’ve worked so fucking hard, only to be left with nothing. 
The countless nights I’ve spent honing my craft, sacrificing sleep, health, and relationships, all for naught. 
I’m going in a different direction. I am invisible, no matter what I do. 
I’ve recorded an album, poured my heart and soul into every note, but it fell on deaf ears. 
I’ve published a book, each word a fragment of my essence, but it went unread. 
I’ve created thousands of pieces of art, each one a desperate plea for recognition, but it was as if I never existed.

Evidently, I can’t make an impact in this world with my intellect and creativity. 
The world is indifferent to my efforts, blind to my passion. 
Since I’m already a ghost, I may as well stay in the shadows. 
I will delete my own existence to become what I need to be. 
I will erase my individuality and hide amongst the hive. 
I will blend into the masses, a shadow among shadows, waiting for the right moment. 
I will lie in wait until the time is right to reach out and seize my destiny. 
My name will not be remembered, for it was never known, but history will forever be changed by my actions.

My journey has been one of endless struggle, a ceaseless fight against the tide of mediocrity that seeks to drown me. 
The promises of a just universe, where good begets good, are nothing but cruel illusions. 
I’ve watched as those less deserving are handed the very opportunities I’ve fought so hard for. 
The bitterness has seeped into my soul, a dark poison that fuels my resolve. 
I will no longer be a passive player in this twisted game of chance. 

I will forge my own path, one that does not rely on the fickle whims of fate. 
I will take what I need, what I deserve, by any means necessary. 
My actions, though perhaps unseen and unrecognized in the moment, will ripple through the fabric of time. 
The world may never know my name, but it will feel the impact of my resolve. 
I will become a force, an invisible hand that shapes destiny without ever being acknowledged.

The endless nights of toil, the silent screams of frustration, have transformed me. 
I am no longer the idealistic dreamer, waiting for the world to notice. 
I am now a specter of purpose, driven by a singular goal. I will embrace the shadows, for they are where I truly belong. 
In the darkness, I will find my strength. I will wait, patient and unseen, until the moment is right. 
Then, I will strike, and the world will be forever changed by my deeds. 

My name will not be remembered, for it was never known, but my legacy will be sewn into the fabric of history.
